Improve your hand reading skills!

Objective of the game is to pic the row of cards with the strongest hand, reveling least cards possible. Each card reveled costs one point, there are 28 points to win in each round if you point to the winning row, otherwise the remaining points will be deducted from your total score!.

Guessing is not a good strategy, try to estimate the odds. Just like in real Texas Holdem, don`t go all in unless you have really strong hand. 

Try to maintain high average playing some more rounds, quick win followed by quick loss is not the bracelet winners path.

Texas Holdem rules, 5 cards out of 7.
